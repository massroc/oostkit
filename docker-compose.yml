# Root docker-compose.yml - Orchestrates all apps in the monorepo
# For development, you can either:
#   1. Run all apps: docker compose up
#   2. Run specific app: docker compose --profile workgroup_pulse up
#   3. Run from app directory: cd apps/workgroup_pulse && docker compose up

# Include app-specific compose files
include:
  - path: apps/portal/docker-compose.yml
    env_file: []
  - path: apps/workgroup_pulse/docker-compose.yml
    env_file: []

# Shared services can be added here as the monorepo grows
# For example, a shared auth service or message queue
