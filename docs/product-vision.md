# Product Vision

## Overview

A suite of online tools supporting Open Systems Theory (OST) methodology. The platform serves two distinct but related audiences.

## Product Lines

### Team Tools

Self-service tools that teams and organisations can use directly.

| Current Name | Description | Status |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Productive Workgroups | 6 Criteria for Productive Work workshop (could rename to "Intrinsic Motivator Workshop") | Production |

These tools enable organisations to run elements of OST methodology themselves. They're designed to be accessible without requiring a trained facilitator, though expert guidance improves outcomes.

### Facilitator Toolkit

Tools for OST practitioners to manage and run engagements.

| Tool | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Referral Tool | PDW participant selection via network referral | Planned |

These tools support the operational aspects of running OST processes - participant selection, engagement management, and other facilitator needs.

## Business Model Considerations

- Organisations could pay for the toolset and deliver their own OST transformation
- Self-service carries risk without expert guidance, but the methodology is publicly available
- The tools make the methodology accessible; expert facilitation makes it effective
- Potential model: tools as entry point, expert facilitation as premium offering

## Market Context

- OST resources are hard to find
- Few people have the complete picture of the methodology
- This platform could be one of the few comprehensive OST toolsets available

## Naming

### Platform Name

TBD. Options being considered:
- Something explicitly OST-related (e.g., `ost-tools`, `opensystems-tools`)
- A brand name that doesn't require knowing OST upfront

### App Names

| Current | Potential Alternatives | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| productive_workgroups | `intrinsic-motivator`, `six-criteria` | Current name comes from OST terminology but may not be immediately clear |

### Considerations

- Explicit OST naming is direct but niche
- Brand naming is more flexible but requires building recognition
- Names don't need to be finalised immediately - renaming is work but possible
