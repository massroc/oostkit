# Product Vision

## Overview

**OOSTKit** (Online Open Systems Theory Kit) - a suite of online tools supporting OST methodology. The platform serves two distinct but related audiences.

## Product Lines

### Tool Catalogue

The platform hosts 12 tools (1 live, 11 coming soon). All tools follow the same model: facilitators log in to create/manage, participants join via links with no friction. The dashboard presents them in a three-column categorized grid (Learning, Workshop Management, Team Workshops).

| Name | Description | Audience | Status |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Workgroup Pulse | 6 Criteria for Productive Work | Teams | Live |
| Workshop Referral Tool (WRT) | Participative selection for design workshops | Facilitators | Coming soon |
| Introduction to Open Systems Thinking | Learn the foundations of democratic organisation design | Everyone | Coming soon |
| Search Conference | Collaborative strategic planning | Facilitators | Coming soon |
| Team Kick-off | TBD | Teams | Coming soon |
| Team Design | TBD | Facilitators | Coming soon |
| Org Design | TBD | Facilitators | Coming soon |
| Skill Matrix | TBD | Teams | Coming soon |
| DP1 Briefing | TBD | Facilitators | Coming soon |
| DP2 Briefing | TBD | Facilitators | Coming soon |
| Collaboration Designer | TBD | Facilitators | Coming soon |
| Org Cadence | TBD | Teams | Coming soon |

Note: Pulse and WRT are both components of the Participative Design Workshop (PDW) process, but the platform presents them as standalone tools. The relationship between tools and OST processes may become explicit in the UI later.

### User Types

Only two types of people interact with OOSTKit:

| | Facilitator | Participant |
|---|---|---|
| **Role** | Creates & manages sessions/workshops | Joins via link |
| **Account** | Yes -- logs in | Never -- no account needed |
| **Pays** | Yes (platform subscription) | No |
| **Examples** | OST practitioners, consultants | Team members, workshop attendees |

Solo facilitator accounts only for now. Organisation/team accounts are a future feature if demand emerges.

## Business Model

### Platform Subscription
- One price unlocks all paid tools (simple, flat pricing to start)
- Can add tiers later if needed
- Pulse is currently free as the top-of-funnel discovery tool (may eventually require facilitator login)

### Revenue Model
- Facilitators pay for the toolset to run their own OST engagements
- Participants always join free via links
- Self-service carries risk without expert guidance, but the methodology is publicly available
- The tools make the methodology accessible; expert facilitation makes it effective
- Potential future model: tools as entry point, expert facilitation as premium offering

## Market Context

- OST resources are hard to find
- Few people have the complete picture of the methodology
- OOSTKit could be one of the few comprehensive OST toolsets available

## Naming

### Platform

**OOSTKit** - Online Open Systems Theory Kit
- Distinctive and memorable
- "Online" differentiates from traditional in-person/paper-based OST
- "Kit" implies practical tools

### Apps

| App | Name | Rationale |
|-----|------|-----------|
| 6 Criteria workshop | **Workgroup Pulse** | Describes what it does - takes the pulse of how the workgroup is doing |
| Participant selection | **Workshop Referral Tool (WRT)** | Clear utility name for facilitators |
| Strategic planning | **Search Conference** | Named after the OST method |
| (9 more tools planned) | See tool catalogue above | Names reflect OST methods or practical utility |
