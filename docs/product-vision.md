# Product Vision

## Overview

**OOSTKit** (Online Open Systems Theory Kit) - a suite of online tools supporting OST methodology. The platform serves two distinct but related audiences.

## Product Lines

### Team Tools

Self-service tools that teams and organisations can use directly.

| Name | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Workgroup Pulse | 6 Criteria for Productive Work - reveals how each member is faring and enables workgroup discussion | Production |

These tools enable organisations to run elements of OST methodology themselves. They're designed to be accessible without requiring a trained facilitator, though expert guidance improves outcomes.

### Facilitator Toolkit

Tools for OST practitioners to manage and run engagements.

| Name | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Workshop Referral Tool (WRT) | PDW participant selection via network referral | Planned |

These tools support the operational aspects of running OST processes - participant selection, engagement management, and other facilitator needs.

## Business Model Considerations

- Organisations could pay for the toolset and deliver their own OST transformation
- Self-service carries risk without expert guidance, but the methodology is publicly available
- The tools make the methodology accessible; expert facilitation makes it effective
- Potential model: tools as entry point, expert facilitation as premium offering

## Market Context

- OST resources are hard to find
- Few people have the complete picture of the methodology
- OOSTKit could be one of the few comprehensive OST toolsets available

## Naming

**OOSTKit** - Online Open Systems Theory Kit

### Apps

| Participant selection | **Workshop Referral Tool (WRT)** | Clear utility name for facilitators |
